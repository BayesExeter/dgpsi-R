\title{Validation plots of a sequential design}
\usage{
draw(object, type, log, ...)

\method{draw}{gp}(object, type = "rmse", log = FALSE, ...)

\method{draw}{dgp}(object, type = "rmse", log = FALSE, ...)

\method{draw}{bundle}(object, type = "rmse", log = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{can be one of the following emulator classes:
\itemize{
\item the S3 class \code{gp}.
\item the S3 class \code{dgp}.
\item the S3 class \code{bundle}.
}}

\item{type}{either \code{rmse}, for the trace plot of RMSEs of emulators constructed during the sequential designs,
or \code{design}, for visualizations of input designs created by the sequential design procedure. Defaults to \code{rmse}.}

\item{log}{a bool that indicates whether to plot RMSEs in log-scale if \code{type = "rmse"}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{N/A.}
}
\value{
A \code{patchwork} object.
}
\description{
This function draws validation plots of the sequential design of a (D)GP emulator or a bundle of (D)GP emulators.
